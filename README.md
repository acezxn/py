### Crack zip file password with Brute method

#### Trial 1: Big Table (brute_bigtable.py)
It seems not good because the table grows as (characters)^(password digits)

#### Trial 2: Looping (brute_loop.py)
Seems better, but harder to build the iterations. Good luck that we have itertools package in Python.
